    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. 
        Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. 
        I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast 
        because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. </li>
        <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. </li>
        <li>Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
